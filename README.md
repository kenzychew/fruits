# Fruits

## Concepts

We want to learn express + mongoose work together, (EJS optional)

These examples only use 1 model -> Fruit

Project 3 needs 2 + 1 (User) -> embedding / referencing

## Setup

1. Setup express -> Hello World
2. Connect mongoose + mongodb
   1. Add on dotenv
3. Create models

## Important stuff

- learn to connect mongoose to express
- learn to write express routes to:
  - Create Fruit
  - Read Fruits -> Read Single Fruit -> Not going to do search
  - Update Fruit
  - Delete Fruit

## Create a Server route

1. Know what is the URL
2. add the code to express to show placeholder on the URL
3. add in the mongoose part -> show response
4. Use EJS to show the response
   1. render the placeholder EJS
   2. change the code to match the data
   3. Link EJS with the data
